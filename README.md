# YoutubePlaylistToUrls


YoutubePlaylistToUrls is a simple website for retreiving every url within a playlist. 

Usage:
   1. Open the page [here](https://eldinzenderink.github.io/youtubeplaylisttourls/).
   2. Insert in the text box the playlist url or id.
   3. Select if you want your list preformatted  (within < pre > tags).
   4. Click on start.
   5. Copy your list to wherever you want.
   6. Have fun :D.

Example Usecase: There is a plugin for foobar2000 (music player) which allows url's from youtube to be added. I wanted to add my playlist as a whole, hence I made this website. (Maybe I am just stupid and the option to parse playlists is already there, but maybe other pograms have this similar feature, so someone else might be in need of a tool like this ^^.)

### Tech

YoutubePlaylistToUrls uses a few external libraries embedded within the executable:

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Duh.
* [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) - Self explainatory.
* [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) - Needed an easy and quick css framework... this works perfect.

### Development
This project is just a one off thing, I won't be adding new features unless it's requested a lot. Bug fixes will happen when issues arrise. 

### Todos
